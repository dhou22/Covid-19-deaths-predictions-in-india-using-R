# Covid-19 deaths prediction in india using R
-------------------------------------------------
**Project Overview**  <br>
This project implements a comprehensive data analysis and prediction system for COVID-19 deaths using R. The system utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically Linear Regression, to analyze historical COVID-19 data and predict future death rates.<br>
The analysis focuses on data from India and includes multiple validation approaches across different time periods.<br> <br>


**Features**  <br>
- Data preprocessing and cleaning pipeline <br>
- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis<br>
- Multiple prediction models using different time windows <br>
- Statistical validation and performance metrics<br>
- Visualization of results and model performance .<br> <br>


**Data Analysis Components**  <br>

1. Data Understanding: <br>
   - Initial data overview and structure analysis <br>
   - Missing value identification and handling <br>
   - Feature distribution analysis <br>
   - Correlation analysis between variables<br>
   - Outlier detection and visualization. <br>
   
2. Data Preparation : <br>
   - Missing data imputation using median/mode replacement <br>
   - Dataset merging and consolidation <br>
   - Outlier handling using IQR method <br>
   - Feature encoding for categorical variables <br>
   - Feature selection based on correlation analysis  <br>
   - Data standardization <br>
   - Statistical testing (Shapiro-Wilk and Kruskal-Wallis tests) <br>
     
3. Modeling Approach: <br>
The project implements three different modeling scenarios: <br>
   - Weeks 1-4 predicting Week 5 <br>
   - Weeks 1-4 predicting Week 6 <br>
   - Week 4 predicting Weeks 5 and 6 <br>
   
4. Model Evaluation :  <br>
Each model is evaluated using multiple metrics: <br>
   - R-squared value <br>
   - Adjusted R-squared <br>
   - Standard Error <br>
   - Visual analysis through scatter plots<br>
   - Residual analysis <br>
   - Kruskal-Wallis test for model validation <br> <br>


**Technical Requirements** <br>
   - R programming environment <br>
   - Required R packages: <br>
       - readr <br>
       - ggplot2 <br>
       - dplyr <br>
       - reshape2 <br>
       - gridExtra <br>
       - lubridate <br> <br>


**Data Requirements** <br>
The system requires two primary datasets: <br>   
- COVID-19 India dataset (covid_19_india.csv) <br>
- General COVID-19 Cases dataset (COVID-19_Cases.csv) <br> <br>


**Performance Insights** <br>
The models demonstrate varying performance levels:  <br>
   - Strong prediction capability for immediate future weeks <br>
   - Declining accuracy for longer-term predictions <br>
   - Robust performance across different regions<br>
   - Statistical significance in regional variation analysis<br> <br>
 


**Future Improvements** <br>
